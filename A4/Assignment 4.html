            How to Install Node.JS
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Before we install Node.JS, we need to get our server up and running. Go the the AWS canvas page, 
                scroll down to Sandbox and click “start lab.” Wait for the circle next to the AWS link to turn green, then click on it.
            </li>
            <li>
                In AWS, find the application called “EC2” and open it. Create a new instance with the following parameters:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Choose Ubuntu Operating system. We will we using the version that is 1 step before the most current version 
                        they have on there which is Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
                        <img class="image" src="choose ubuntu.png" width="600">
                    </li>
                    <li> In the Keypair dropdown options, select “Proceed without Keypair”.</li>
                    <li>Check “Allow HTTP traffic” and “Allow HTTPS traffic.”</li>
                    <li>Under the configure storage section, change “8 GiB” to “28 GiB” 
                        <img class="image" src="configure storage.png" width="600">
                    </li>
                    <li>Launch the instance.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Wait for the instance state to to change from “pending” to “running,” then click on it and click 
                “connect” to connect to the instance. This should open the console for our new instance of the virtual machine
            </li>
            <li>Now we're ready to install node.JS! All you have to do is paste the following into the command line then hit Enter:
                curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tejaswigowda/f289e9bff13d152876e8d4b3281142f8/raw/df37df2e16a3166e686357a045751a7c18bbeebe/installNodeMongoUbuntu16.04.sh  | bash
            </li>
            <li>If you're planning on using HTTPS, paste the following into the command line as well:
                npm install greenlock-express@2
            </li>
            <li>And that's it! We're ready to load our files into the virtual machine. If you have a github repo, you can type "git clone [paste your url here] and 
                it will clone the repository to the AWS machine.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            How to Intsall and run the MongoDB Server
        </h3>
        <p>You're going to want to use Mongo Compass, so make sure you have that installed onto your laptop.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Once your server is up and running, type "sudo service mongod status" into the command line to check the current status of the mongo server.
                If Mongo is installed, you should get a message indicating that the the MongoDB service is loaded, but not active.
                To start the service, type "sudo service mongod start" into the command line. If you check the status again, the message will have changed to
                indicate that MongoDB is active and running.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now, we can connect this MongoDB service to Mongo Compass for a better user interface. To do this, we need to connect Mongo Compass to our AWS machine.
                Open Mongo Compass, and replace "localhost" to the public IP of the AWS machine. My AWS public IP address is 54.163.3.175, so it looks like this once I make
                changes:
                <img class="image" src="mongo compass.png">
            </li>
            <li>
                Now we need to change the setting of our AWS instance to allow Mongo Compass to access the databases in our cloud server. To do this, we need to add a rule
                that allows the Mongo Compass application on our computer to represent data from the AWS machine. Navigate to the instances page, and click on security groups.
                Edit the inbound rules, and add a rule with <b>port 27017</b> and <b>source set to my IP</b>. Then save.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, we need to change MongoDB's configuration file in our AWS machine. Go back to the terminal of the virtual machine and type "sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf".
                This will allow you to edit the configuration file by typing directing into it. Scroll down to where it says "bindIP" and replace the IP to <b>0.0.0.0</b>. Exit
                with ctrl+X, type "Y" to save changes, the hit Enter. Restart MongoDB with the restart command "sudo service mongod restart".
                <img class="image" src="mongo db shell.png" width="800">
            </li>
            <p>And that's it! MongoDB and Mongo Compass are now two clients connected to the same server (the AWS machine). You can access and edit collections in the database
                using the MongoDB shell in the AWS terminal, or on Mongo Compass.
