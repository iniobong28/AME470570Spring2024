            How to Install Node.JS
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Before we install Node.JS, we need to get our server up and running. Go the the AWS canvas page, 
                scroll down to Sandbox and click “start lab.” Wait for the circle next to the AWS link to turn green, then click on it.
            </li>
            <li>
                In AWS, find the application called “EC2” and open it. Create a new instance with the following parameters:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Choose Ubuntu Operating system. We will we using the version that is 1 step before the most current version 
                        they have on there which is Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
                        <img class="image" src="choose ubuntu.png" width="600">
                    </li>
                    <li> In the Keypair dropdown options, select “Proceed without Keypair”.</li>
                    <li>Check “Allow HTTP traffic” and “Allow HTTPS traffic.”</li>
                    <li>Under the configure storage section, change “8 GiB” to “28 GiB” 
                        <img class="image" src="configure storage.png" width="600">
                    </li>
                    <li>Launch the instance.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Wait for the instance state to to change from “pending” to “running,” then click on it and click 
                “connect” to connect to the instance. This should open the console for our new instance of the virtual machine
            </li>
            <li>Now we're ready to install node.JS! All you have to do is paste the following into the command line then hit Enter:
                curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tejaswigowda/f289e9bff13d152876e8d4b3281142f8/raw/df37df2e16a3166e686357a045751a7c18bbeebe/installNodeMongoUbuntu16.04.sh  | bash
            </li>
            <li>If you're planning on using HTTPS, paste the following into the command line as well:
                npm install greenlock-express@2
            </li>
            <li>And that's it! We're ready to load our files into the virtual machine. If you have a github repo, you can type "git clone [paste your url here] and 
                it will clone the repository to the AWS machine.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            How to Intsall and run the MongoDB Server
        </h3>
        <p>You're going to want to use Mongo Compass, so make sure you have that installed onto your laptop.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Once your server is up and running, type "sudo service mongod status" into the command line to check the current status of the mongo server.
                If Mongo is installed, you should get a message indicating that the the MongoDB service is loaded, but not active.
                To start the service, type "sudo service mongod start" into the command line. If you check the status again, the message will have changed to
                indicate that MongoDB is active and running.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now, we can connect this MongoDB service to Mongo Compass for a better user interface. To do this, we need to connect Mongo Compass to our AWS machine.
                Open Mongo Compass, and replace "localhost" to the public IP of the AWS machine. My AWS public IP address is 54.163.3.175, so it looks like this once I make
                changes:
                <img class="image" src="mongo compass.png">
            </li>
            <li>
                Now we need to change the setting of our AWS instance to allow Mongo Compass to access the databases in our cloud server. To do this, we need to add a rule
                that allows the Mongo Compass application on our computer to represent data from the AWS machine. Navigate to the instances page, and click on security groups.
                Edit the inbound rules, and add a rule with <b>port 27017</b> and <b>source set to my IP</b>. Then save.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, we need to change MongoDB's configuration file in our AWS machine. Go back to the terminal of the virtual machine and type "sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf".
                This will allow you to edit the configuration file by typing directing into it. Scroll down to where it says "bindIP" and replace the IP to <b>0.0.0.0</b>. Exit
                with ctrl+X, type "Y" to save changes, the hit Enter. Restart MongoDB with the restart command "sudo service mongod restart".
                <img class="image" src="mongo db shell.png" width="800">
            </li>
            <p>And that's it! MongoDB and Mongo Compass are now two clients connected to the same server (the AWS machine). You can access and edit collections in the database
                using the MongoDB shell in the AWS terminal, or on Mongo Compass.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            How to Use the App
        </h3>
        <p>
            This app is intuitive and easy to use. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To add a new feed, click the "add feed" button and past the URL of the RSS feed you wish to display. If a valid URL is submitted, the feed will
                appear on the leftmost column on the webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                To edit the name of a feed, first click on the feed to select it. You can tell when a feed is selected if it is highlighted in gold color.
                After selecting the feed, click on the "edit feed" button. Now you can change the display name of the feed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigating your feeds is simple. Click on the feed you want to view and the contents of the feed will be listed in the middle column. To view
                details of each feed entry, simply click on it and the details will be displayed on the rightmost column.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Delete Functionality
        </h3>
        <p>
            To implement delete feed Functionality in our RSS app, we must change our code in the server.js file and the index.html files. In
            index.html, we define a new function, delete(), inside the script tag. In this function, we define a variable that takes in the currently
            selected feed (aka the feed that the user wants to delete). We ask the user to confirm if they want to delete using the in-built function
            confirm(). If they select yes, we use AJAX to asynchrnously delete the selected item without affecting the other items in the feed list.
            This is done by sending a JSON object that will be parsed by the server.
            Below is the JavaScript code I used in the index.html file:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                function deleteFeed(){

                    var item = allFeeds[currSelectedFeed];
                    confirmation = confirm("Are you sure you want to delete " + item.name + "?");
                    if (confirmation){
                        $.ajax({
                            url: './deleteFeed?id=' + item._id + '&name=' + item.name,
                            type: 'GET',
                            success: function (data) {
                                main();
                            },
                            error: function (error) {
                                console.log(error);
                            }
                        });
                    return;
                    }
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The next thing we need to do is make sure that the database will be updated on the server side. To do this, we must define a function in 
            server.js. This function recieves the JSON object and uses the information we defined in it to delete the appropriate data in the feed list 
            collection. Below is the JavaScript code I used in server.js:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                app.get("/deleteFeed", function (req, res) {
                    var url = req.query.id;
                    var name = req.query.name;
                    db.collection('feeds').remove({ _id: MS.helper.toObjectID(url) }, function (err, result) {
                        res.send("ok");
                    });
                }) 
            </code>
        </pre>

        </div>
    </body>
